### **Daily Schedule (Weekdays)**  
**1. Early Morning (5:30 AM – 8:30 AM)**  
- **Focus**: *MTurk Batch Tasks & Quick HITs*  
- **Why**: US workers log off around this time (US evening), leaving behind unfinished batches. Use scripts to grab leftovers.  
- **Gemini Edge**: Your adaptability helps you switch between quick surveys, data entry, or transcriptions.  

**2. Late Morning (10 AM – 12 PM)**  
- **Focus**: *Clickworker/UHRS Assessments*  
- **Why**: EU morning starts, flooding UHRS with tasks like search engine evaluation or moderation.  
- **Earth Tiger Tactics**: Be bold – target high-paying “judgment” tasks first. Avoid low-effort spam.  

**3. Afternoon (2 PM – 5 PM)**  
- **Focus**: *Prolific Academic Studies*  
- **Why**: UK researchers post studies during their morning/afternoon (GMT). Prioritize psychology/social science studies.  
- **Life Path 9 Alignment**: Choose studies that feel meaningful (e.g., mental health, education).  

**4. Evening (7 PM – 10 PM)**  
- **Focus**: *MTurk High-Paying HITs*  
- **Why**: US daytime begins (7 PM your time = 8 AM EST). Use MTurk Suite to snipe premium HITs (e.g., $5+ surveys).  
- **Gemini + Tiger Synergy**: Communicate with requester forums to unlock closed quals.  

**5. Night Owl Window (11 PM – 1 AM)**  
- **Focus**: *Prolific US Studies & MTurk Night Batches*  
- **Why**: US West Coast researchers (PST) post studies until 1 AM your time.  
- **Caution**: Limit this slot to 2-3 days/week to avoid burnout (Geminis need mental rest).

### **Weekend Strategy**  
- **Mornings (6 AM – 10 AM)**: Grind MTurk batches (e.g., receipt transcriptions, product tagging).  
- **Afternoons (12 PM – 3 PM)**: UHRS “weekend surge” tasks (e.g., video moderation, sentiment analysis).  
- **Evenings (5 PM – 8 PM)**: Wrap up Prolific studies with weekend-specific bonuses (e.g., longitudinal research).

### **Customized Tips for Raihan**  
1. **Avoid Midday Lulls (12 PM – 2 PM)**: Use this time for skill-building (e.g., Coursera courses for higher-paying quals).  
2. **Wednesday/Thursday Priority**: Prolific studies peak midweek (researchers rush deadlines).  
3. **Full Moon Days**: Channel your Earth Tiger’s boldness – negotiate bonuses with requesters (e.g., “I’ll complete 100 HITs for a 10% bump”).
