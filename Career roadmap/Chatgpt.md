1. Your Profile

Western Zodiac

Gemini Sun:
You’re naturally curious, adaptable, and excellent at learning new skills—a quality that powered your success with the 200 Days of Code challenge. However, Gemini’s dual nature means that under stress, your focus can scatter, making decision–making about your career overwhelming.

Cancer Moon:
Emotionally sensitive and deeply nurturing, you thrive in environments that offer predictability, routine, and a safe space. This placement highlights your need for gentle, stable work conditions—especially crucial given your ongoing battles with depression, anxiety, and panic disorder.

Scorpio Rising:
Your outward demeanor is intense, determined, and transformative. Scorpio rising lends you a strategic mindset and a drive for mastery, yet can also amplify internal stress when faced with chaos or uncertainty.


Chinese Zodiac

Earth Tiger:
As an Earth Tiger, you are courageous and independent with a natural entrepreneurial spirit. This energy supports your ability to tackle challenges but also warns of potential burnout if you overextend without proper structure.


Numerology

Life Path 9:
Your core nature is humanitarian, idealistic, and compassionate. You are driven to make a positive impact and are learning to let go of past burdens to embrace transformation.

Expression 7:
This number highlights your analytical and introspective abilities, making you well–suited for focused, detail–oriented tasks that can be done independently.

Soul Urge 5:
You have a deep desire for freedom, variety, and independence. Your ideal work environment is one that offers flexibility and minimal external pressure, aligning perfectly with your need for ready–made assignments and minimal direct client interaction.

2. Your Current Situation & Key Requirements

Background:
You were a dedicated programmer who excelled at coding challenges and problem–solving. Since May 2022, however, you’ve struggled with mental health issues—including depression, anxiety, and panic disorder—that have forced you to pause your programming career.

Mental Health & Work Needs:

Intense stress triggers severe anxiety and emotional breakdowns (e.g., headaches and crying) when thinking about career decisions.

You are under medical treatment (Reelife, Oxapro 5), yet remain uncertain about the effectiveness.

You wish to avoid client bidding, video interviews, and constant direct interactions that amplify your stress.


Income & Independence:
You need to secure a steady, low–stress income quickly to cover your basic expenses while building toward long–term independence. You prefer ready–made assignments with clear deliverables and predictable routines.
